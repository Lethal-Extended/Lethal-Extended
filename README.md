`DISCLAIMER!!!`

This modpack contains music that is copyrighted and may not be suitable for content creators however, we have a music switcher that will replace
copyrighted music with our music made in-house.

This modpack also contains references that some players may find offensive or inappropriate:

- Gambling

- Alcohol and Drugs

`Warning`

Mods cause a dip in performance, it is especially notable on lower-end machines. 

The official requirements for Lethal Company are as follows:

Processor: Intel Core i5-7400 CPU @ 3.00GHz
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050

While you absolutely can game on lower-tier hardware, you WILL experience lower frames than your vanilla gameplay experience. We try our best to fix performance issues however not everything can be fixed. 

With the modpack installed, I average around 35-70fps

My specs: 

Processor: Intel Core i5-8700
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080
