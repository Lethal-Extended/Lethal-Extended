THIS MODPACK IS PRE-PACKAGED AND MAINTAINED BY ME, THERE IS NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING ELSE.

This modpack is for manual installer or people who want to use our auto-installer. If you use a modmanager please go here: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/PenguCC/LethalExtendedModManager/

`Auto-Installer`

If your game is on your C:\ Drive then run `install.bat`

If your game is on any other storage device, then run `install-other.bat`. It will prompt you for a drive letter, please ONLY type the letter of the Drive the game is installed to
(Example: D) and NOT (D:\)

DO NOT COPY THE FILES TO YOUR GAME AND THEN RUN THE INSTALLER!!!! IF YOU'VE COPIED THEM TO THE GAME THEN YOU HAVE INSTALLED EVERYTHING YOURSELF

`Auto-Updater`

After Installing the pack, a shortcut will be installed onto your desktop. I recommend keeping it there so you can easily download newer releases of the pack and install them

`DMCA`

If ANYONE has an issue with their mods being used PLEASE contact me on Discord: pengucc

I will do my best to resolve issues, however I love the work that all of the developers of these mods are doing.
If any of you mod devs join my Discord you will all receive a role showing you are a mod contributor.
